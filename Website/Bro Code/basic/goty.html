         <div class="img"><img src="../images/Witcher 3.jpeg" class="img" width="675" height="400" alt="Witcher 3"></div>

         <p class="paragraph">Look, all of the 2015 nominees were amazing, but this category belonged to The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. It's many</p>
         <p class="paragraph">people's favorite game, and everyone knew it would win. However, maybe you think one of these games should</p>
         <p class="paragraph">have won:</p><br>
         <p class="paragraph">- Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</p>
         <p class="paragraph">- Bloodborne</p>
         <p class="paragraph">- Super Mario Maker</p>
         <p class="paragraph">- Fallout 4</p>

         <div class="title_div"><h3 class="title">2016 Game of the Year Winner: Overwatch</h3></div>
         <div class="img"><img src="../images/Overwatch.jpeg" class="img" width="700" height="400" alt="Overwatch"></div>

         <p class="paragraph">It's very impressive that Overwatch is still going strong 7 years later, but it's even more impressive that it won the</p>
         <p class="paragraph">Game of the Year award in 2016. It had strong competition in the form of some extremely popular games; let's</p>
         <p class="paragraph">check some of them out:</p><br>
         <p class="paragraph">- Titanfall 2</p>
         <p class="paragraph">- Doom</p>
         <p class="paragraph">- Inside</p>
         <p class="paragraph">- Uncharted 4: A Thief's End</p>

         <div class="title_div"><h3 class="title">2017 Game of the Year Winner: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</h3></div>
         <div class="img"><img src="../images/Legend of Zelda.jpeg" class="img" width="700" height="400" alt="Legend of Zelda"></div>

         <p class="paragraph">It's been 6 years since this game came out, and fans have been counting the days until its sequel releases. This a</p>
         <p class="paragraph">testament to how beloved the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is, so it should come as no surprise that it won in</p>
         <p class="paragraph">2017. But maybe another game deserved to win; take a look at the other nominees and decide:</p><br>
         <p class="paragraph">- PlayerUnknow's Battlegrounds</p>
         <p class="paragraph">- Horizon Zero Dawn</p>
         <p class="paragraph">- Super Mario Odyssey</p>
         <p class="paragraph">- Persona 5</p>

         <div class="title_div"><h3 class="title">2018 Game of the Year: God of War</h3></div>
         <div class="img"><img src="../images/God of War 2018.jpg" class="img" width="700" height="400" alt="God of War 2018"></div>

         <p class="paragraph">A decade ago, God of War was very popular. But even its hardcore fans probably never imagined that not only would</p>
         <p class="paragraph">it become that popular again, but that it would surpass that level of fame. The 2018 version of God of War</p>
         <p class="paragraph">reinvigorated the franchise, and it ended up winning the Game of the Year in 2018. Let's look at the competition it</p>
         <p class="paragraph">had:</p><br>
         <p class="paragraph">- Monster Hunter: World</p>
         <p class="paragraph">- Assassin's Creed Odyssey</p>
         <p class="paragraph">- Marvel's Spider-Man</p>
         <p class="paragraph">- Red Dead Redemption 2</p>
         <p class="paragraph">- Celeste</p>

         <div class="title_div"><h3 class="title">2019 Game of the Year Winner: Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</h3></div>
         <div class="img"><img src="../images/Sekiro.jpeg" class="img" width="700" height="400" alt="Sekiro"></div>

         <p class="paragraph">After getting two of their games nominated but not winning, FromSoftware finally won the big one with their game</p>
         <p class="paragraph">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. Although this game is amazing and people love it, it was surprising that it won over the</p>
         <p class="paragraph">juggernaut that is Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Here are the rest of the nominees:</p><br>
         <p class="paragraph">- Resident Evil 2</p>
         <p class="paragraph">- The Outer Worlds</p>
         <p class="paragraph">- Death Stranding</p>
         <p class="paragraph">- Control</p>
         <p class="paragraph">- Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</p>

         <div class="title_div"><h3 class="title">2020 Game of the Year Winner: The Last of Us Part II</h3></div>
         <div class="img"><img src="../images/The Last Of Us part 2.jpg" class="img" width="700" height="400" alt="The Last Of Us part 2"></div>

         <p class="paragraph">Although the game might have been divisive with players, it was a hit at the award show. It won in numerous</p>
         <p class="paragraph">categories, including Game of the Year. 2020, in particular, was stacked with great games, and all of them had a</p>
         <p class="paragraph">strong argument for why they should win. The other nominees were:</p><br>
         <p class="paragraph">- Hades</p>
         <p class="paragraph">- Animal Crossing: New Horizons</p>
         <p class="paragraph">- Doom Eternal</p>
         <p class="paragraph">- Ghost of Tsushima</p>
         <p class="paragraph">- Final Fantasy VII Remake</p>

         <div class="title_div"><h3 class="title">2021 Game of the Year Winner: It Takes Two</h3></div>
         <div class="img"><img src="../images/It Takes Two.jpeg" class="img" width="700" height="400" alt="It Takes Two"></div>

         <p class="paragraph">Hazelight, the developer of It Takes Two, had a popular game in A Way Out. However, nobody expected their next</p>
         <p class="paragraph">game to be as huge as it was. It Takes Two took the world by storm, and it won in 2021. Let's look at the</p>
         <p class="paragraph">competition it had:</p><br>
         <p class="paragraph">- Resident Evil Village</p>
         <p class="paragraph">- Metroid Dread</p>
         <p class="paragraph">- Deathloop</p>
         <p class="paragraph">- Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart</p>
         <p class="paragraph">- Psychonauts 2</p>

         <div class="title_div"><h3 class="title">2022 Game of the Year Winner: Elden Ring</h3></div>
         <div class="img"><img src="../images/Elden Ring.jpeg" class="img" width="700" height="400" alt="Elden Ring"></div>

         <p class="paragraph">No offense to the other games that were nominated, but everyone knew that the real competition was between two</p>
         <p class="paragraph">specific games, God of War Ragnarok and Elden Ring. These two colossuses fought, and Elden Ring came out the</p>
         <p class="paragraph">victor. Check out the other games that were in contention:</p><br>
         <p class="paragraph">- Xenoblade Chronicles 3</p>
         <p class="paragraph">- A Plague Tale: Requiem</p>
         <p class="paragraph">- Horizon Forbidden West</p>
         <p class="paragraph">- Stray</p>
         <p class="paragraph">- God of War: Ragnarok</p>
