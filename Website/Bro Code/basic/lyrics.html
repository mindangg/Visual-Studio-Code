         There ain't no gold in this river
         That I've been washin' my hands in forever
         I know there is hope in these waters
         But I can't bring myself to swim
         When I am drowning in this silence
         Baby, let me in

         Go easy on me, baby
         I was still a child
         Didn't get the chance to
         Feel the world around me
         I had no time to choose
         What I chose to do
         So go easy on me

         There ain't no room for things to change
         When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
         You can't deny how hard I've tried
         I changed who I was to put you both first
         But now I give up

         Go easy on me, baby
         I was still a child
         Didn't get the chance to
         Feel the world around me
         Had no time to choose
         What I chose to do
         So go easy on me

         I had good intentions
         And the highest hopes
         But I know right now
         It probably doesn't even show

         Go easy on me, baby
         I was still a child
         I didn't get the chance to
         Feel the world around me
         I had no time to choose
         What I chose to do
         So go easy on me
